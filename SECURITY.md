## Reporting a Vulnerability

The go-chess team and community take security bugs seriously. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings, and will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

To report a security issue, please use the GitHub Security Advisory ["Report a Vulnerability"](https://github.com/rumendamyanov/go-chess/security/advisories/new) tab.

The go-chess team will send a response indicating the next steps in handling your report. After the initial reply to your report, the security team will keep you informed of the progress towards a fix and full announcement, and may ask for additional information or guidance.

### When Should I Report a Vulnerability?

- You think you discovered a potential security vulnerability in go-chess
- You are unsure how a vulnerability affects go-chess
- You think you discovered a vulnerability in another project that go-chess depends on

### When Should I NOT Report a Vulnerability?

- You need help tuning go-chess components for security
- You need help applying security related updates
- Your issue is not security related
